# How to deploy a static Next.js website on Github Pages

##### Using Next.js version 12.1.6

## Introduction

I've wanted to build a cool, or at least presentable, Portfolio-Blog for a while now. Since I've been working a lot with Next.js lately, I figured it would be a great idea to build this portfolio using Next.js instead of some plain html/css/js. And since I didn't want to pay for hosting just right now, Github Pages should do the trick.

The original idea was to **next build** and **next export** the project and then manually upload the generated files to a repository. Since this didn't work the way I was thinking, I searched and found an even better solution. This involves using Github Actions and a third party CI/CD solution available at Github Marketplace. The one I used is ["Deploy to Github Pages"](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages).

### 1. Github Actions

1. In your repository go to actions and add a workflow by choosing Node.js:

2. You'll get a **node.js.yml** file like the one bellow:

   ```yml
   # This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
   # For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions

   name: Node.js CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: ['main']
     pull_request:
       branches: ['main']

     jobs:
     build:

     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     strategy:
       matrix:
         node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x]
         # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
           cache: 'npm'
       - run: npm ci
       - run: npm run build --if-present
       - run: npm test
   ```

3. Select the node version e.g. **node-version: [16.x]** then start replacing at **- run: npm ci** like the code below. Since I'm using **yarn** I also changed the respective **npm** commands. For example: **run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile** is equivalent to **run: npm ci**.

   We also need to bypass Jekyll since it doesn't recognize folders that start with an underscore, like "\_next". More about bypassing Jekyll on Github [Github Blog](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61450307/js-and-css-not-loading-when-hosting-next-application-on-github-pages).

   The section starting with **- name: Deploy** is the ["Deploy to Github Pages"](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages).

   ```yml
   - run: npm install -g yarn # Installs yarn.
   - run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile # Performs a clean install.
   - run: yarn build && export # Generates and exports files into "out" folder.
   - run: touch ./out/.nojekyll # This bypasses Github's Jekyll since it doesn't recognize folders that start with an underscore, like "_next".

   - name: Deploy
     uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.3.3
     with:
       branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
       folder: out # The folder the action should deploy.
   ```

4. The content of the folder **out** is then deployed to the **gh-pages** branch, which is then used by Github Pages.

### 2. Next.js config

#### - Custom image loader & basePath

1. In the Next.js application, we need to change the **next.config.js** file. We need to add a custom image loader since the standard one doesn't support **next export** which you can see in the error message bellow. More about built-in image loaders [official doc](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader-configuration). This was a trial and error and the one that worked for me was the "akamai".

   Error message:

   ```txt
   Error: Image Optimization using Next.js' default loader is not compatible with `next export`.
     Possible solutions:
       - Use `next start` to run a server, which includes the Image Optimization API.
       - Use any provider which supports Image Optimization (like Vercel).
       - Configure a third-party loader in `next.config.js`.
       - Use the `loader` prop for `next/image`.
     Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/export-image-api
   ```

   next.config.js:

   ```js
   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
   const nextConfig = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     images: {
       loader: 'akamai',
       path: isProd ? 'https://<your github account>.github.io/' : '',
     },
     basePath: '/<your github repo>',
   };

   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```

2. As seen above, you also need to define a **basePath**. The reason behind it is that images/assets will not load because your repository name will be part of the URL. There is another option called [assetPrefix](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/cdn-support-with-asset-prefix) but it is discouraged. By the way you can also use a **isProduction** variable like this:

   next.config.js:

   ```js
   const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
   //and then something like this ternary :
   basePath: isProd ? '/<your github repo>' : '',
   ```

#### - Changing Image src

1. Replace each image src as described in the [official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath#images)

   ```jsx
   <Image
     src='/images/profile-pic.png'
     width={360}
     height={360}
     alt='profile-pic'
   />
   ```

   ```jsx
   <Image
     src='/<your github repo>/images/profile-pic.png'
     width={360}
     height={360}
     alt='profile-pic'
   />
   ```

Thanks for following until here and I hope it helps you too!
